Spanning Tree Protocol
The spanning tree protocol is also known as STP. 
It is a protocol that monitors the overall performance of the network. 
The main task of the spanning tree protocol is to remove the redundant links.
This protocol uses the Spanning tree algorithm (STA), which is used to detect the redundant link. 
The STA maintains the topology database that is used to find the redundant links. 
If the redundant link is found, then the link gets disabled. Once the redundant links are removed, then only those links will remain active which are chosen by the STA. If a new link is added or some existing link is removed, then the STA will be re-executed to adjust the changes.

Before understanding the spanning tree protocol, we first looked at the complete graph and spanning tree.

A complete graph is a graph in which a line connects each pair of vertices. In other words, we can say that all the points are connected by a maximum number of lines. In computer networking, the complete graph can also be said as a fully meshed network.
